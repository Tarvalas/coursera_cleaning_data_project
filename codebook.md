## Project Description

The script, run_analysis.R was created as the course project for the Coursera 
course, "Getting and cleaning Data". It is a program that takes the raw dataset,
makes it tidy, and provides averages of some variables.


## Study Design and Data Processing

### Collection of the Raw Data

The raw data was collected from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy smartphones 
as part of a study. The raw data was provided by the course instructor through the link,

as well as a link to the site where the data was obtained:

### Creating the Tidy Data File

For installation instructions, as well as a description of what the "run_analysis.R"
script does, consult the README at:

## Tidy Dataset and Variables

The tidy dataset contained in "tidy_average.txt" contains 180 observations of 68
variables. For a description of these variables, consult the README included in the
raw data file, "UCI HAR DATASET".
